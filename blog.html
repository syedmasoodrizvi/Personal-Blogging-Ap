        Cricket, often referred to as a "gentleman's game," has evolved into a global phenomenon that transcends borders, cultures, and languages. 
        With its rich history, thrilling matches, and fervent fan base, cricket has become more than just a sport; it's a way of life for millions around the

        maintaining a balance between different formats of the game (Test, One-Day, and T20), ensuring player well-being, and combating corruption. However, 
        these challenges also present opportunities for the sport's administrators, players, and fans to collaborate in ensuring its long-term success.
        In conclusion, cricket is more than a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that unites people, ignites passion, and influences societies across the globe. 
        Its journey from humble beginnings to international stardom reflects the power of sports to bridge divides and bring joy to millions. Cricket's timeless
         appeal continues to inspire new generations and shape the narrative of an ever-evolving world.

        Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about 2 degrees 
        Fahrenheit. Between 1880—the year that accurate recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) 
        every 10 years. Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise 
        by 0.18 degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade. The result? A planet that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10 warmest years since 
        1880 have occurred since 2005—and the 5 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015. Climate change deniers have argued that there has been a
         “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but numerous studies, including a 2018 paper published in the journal Environmental Research 
         Letters, have disproved this claim. The impacts of global warming are already harming people around the world.

        After several experiments in economic restructuring, Pakistan currently operates a mixed economy in which state-owned enterprises account for a large
         portion of gross domestic product (GDP). The country has experimented with several economic models during its existence. At first, Pakistan’s economy
          was largely based on private enterprise, but significant sectors of it were nationalized beginning in the early 1970s, including financial services, 
          manufacturing, and transportation. Further changes were made in the 1980s, under the military government of Zia ul-Haq. Specifically, an “Islamic” 
          economy was introduced, which outlawed practices forbidden by Sharīʿah (Muslim law)—e.g., charging interest on loans (ribā )—and mandated such 
          traditional religious practices as the payment of zakāt (tithe) and ʿushr (land tax). Though portions of the Islamic economy have remained in place, 
          the state began in the 1990s to privatize—in whole or in part—large sectors of the nationalized economy. The economy, which was primarily agricultural
          at the time of independence, has become considerably diversified. Agriculture, now no longer the largest sector, contributes roughly one-fifth of GDP,
          while manufacturing provides about one-sixth. Trade and services, which combined constitute the largest component of the economy, have grown 
          considerably.
